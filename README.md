# Project: Call Center Dashboard (Youtube Guided Project)
## Project Overview 
The Call Center Dashboard project involved building a dynamic dashboard that offers real-time insights into call center operations.
By visualizing critical metrics such as call channel, call response time, and customer satisfaction, the dashboard provides stakeholders with an interactive platform for monitoring and improving service quality.

## Goal/Objective
The primary goal of this project was to create a real-time monitoring system for a call center.
The dashboard allows management to quickly identify operational issues, such as long wait times or high call volumes, and make informed decisions to enhance both efficiency and customer satisfaction.
## Business Needs
The call centers needed an effective tool to:
- Track Real-Time Performance: Management required continuous monitoring of key metrics to quickly address any issues affecting operational performance, such as increased wait times.
  
- Optimize Resource Allocation: By identifying call volume trends, the business could adjust staffing and resource deployment to match demand, improving productivity without overspending on labor.

- Enhance Customer Satisfaction: By monitoring customer satisfaction scores alongside other metrics, the business sought to proactively improve the quality of customer interactions.

## Tools
Microsoft Excel

## Data Cleaning
The dataset contains 4 call centers data for the month of October, the year 2020.
The dataset was cleaned by formatting data to their correct data types, and handling missing values.
No duplicates were found in the data.

## Data Analysis
I conducted a detailed analysis of the clean data to uncover patterns such as customer satisfaction, total inbound calls, calls response time, number of calls through each channel and call center.
For example, through the dashboard’s visualization, management could quickly see where call volumes surged and adjust accordingly.

## Real-Time Visualization
I presented insights through intuitive data visualizations such as bar charts for response time and call sentiments, pie charts for channel distribution and column charts for total inbound calls.
The dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter data by call day and call center slicers, facilitating more focused decision-making.

## Actionable Recommendations
The real-time monitoring capabilities of the dashboard could empower management to take immediate action, such as investigating customer dissatisfaction patterns.
By addressing the call center’s operational and business needs through data-driven insights, the dashboard not only improves efficiency but also contributes to a better customer experience.
